Dev Log
I used React and Inertia for my Chirper assignment given to us by our professor. I created a new directory on my Desktop using commands from Linux like LS for listing files and folders, CD to change directory, and mkdir to make a new directory entitled Chirper.

Installing Laravel Breeze and running both npm run dev and php artisan serve feel similar to me. We also did the same commands for our OJT. The SQLite that it came with is hard to read. Opening it in VSCode would result in weird symbols and hardly readable text. However, I can tell if a new user has been registered since I can see the username I gave it when I registered. I also tried deleting my registered user to see if the SQLite file will update.

I was able to stop at showing the chirp. I am now exploring the link at the bottom to explore chirp further. I look forward in exploring Models and Controllers. They are both similar to me because I joined a mobile app development training by DICT. I was introduced in the concept of APIs, Laravel, and Flutter. I further learned APIs through a seminar hosted by the club GDSC. 

Models act like a blueprint of the thing I am making. Like for example a model of a user. It should have a username and password. It can also have methods and other functions.

Controllers are crucial for APIs because they control the flow of information and request. API is like the waiter who will take an order from you (a request) and give it to the kitchen (the computer/server). After processing the request, if it was correctly made, the output will be given to you by the API. For example, I want to fetch the data of the total number of profiles or the total counts of all the male and female. Controllers have functions and methods too for the API to handle your request and communicate what you want from the server. 

The difference between models and controllers is that Models serve as the scaffolding for the user, but the controller will control the information like receiving the username and password you gave, and do actions like storing, displaying, changing, or deleting it. Model is more of a noun and Controllers are verbs.
