Instruction:

Build chirper with inertia, and perform the instructions up to Showing chirp, 
push it to a new repo in GitHub and message to me the repo link. 

Deadline Sunday 11:59 pm.

I used React for my chirper. I created a new directory on my Desktop using 
commands from Linux like LS for listing files and folders, CD to change 
directory, and mkdir to make the directory Chirper.

Installing Laravel Breeze and running both npm run dev and php artisan serve
feel similar. We also do the same commands for our OJT. The SQLite that it
came with is hard to read. However, I can tell if a new user has been registered.
I also tried deleting my registered user. 

I was able to stop at showing the chirp. I am now exploring the link at the bottom
to explore chirp further.
